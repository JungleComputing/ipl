/** 
 * The Ibis abstraction for data to be read.
 * <p>
 * A <code>ReadMessage</code> is obtained from a
 * {@link ibis.ipl.ReceivePort receiveport}, either
 * by means of an upcall, or by means of an explicit receive, which is
 * accomplished by call to {@link ibis.ipl.ReceivePort#receive() receive}.
 * A {@link ibis.ipl.ReceivePort receiveport} can be configured to generate
 * upcalls or to support blocking receive, but NOT both!
 * At most one <code>ReadMessage</code> is alive at one time for a given
 * </code>ReceivePort</code>.
 * <p>
 * For all read methods in this class, the invariant is that the reads must
 * match the writes one by one. An exception to this rule is that an
 * array written with any of the <code>writeArray</code> methods of
 * {@link WriteMessage} can be read by {@link #readObject}. Likewise, an
 * array written with the {@link WriteMessage#writeByteBuffer} method can be read
 * by {@link #readObject} (resulting in a byte array), and also by the
 * {@link #readArray(byte[])} method.
 * <strong>
 * In contrast, an array written with
 * {@link WriteMessage#writeObject writeObject}
 * cannot be read with <code>readArray</code>, because
 * {@link WriteMessage#writeObject writeObject} does duplicate detection,
 * and may have written only a handle.
 * </strong>
 * However, an array written with {@link WriteMessage#writeArray(byte[])} can be
 * read with {@link #readByteBuffer(ByteBuffer)}.
