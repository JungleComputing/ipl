/**
 * Represents a location on which an Ibis instance runs. This is the
 * data type returned by {@link IbisIdentifier#location()}.
 * It represents a number of levels, for instance hostname, domain,
 * in that order, t.i., from detailed to coarse.
 * Level 0 represents the most detailed, level {@link #numberOfLevels()}-1
 * the most coarse.
 * <p>
 * Locations should be comparable with <code>equals()</code>, so implementations
 * probably redefine <code>hashCode()</code> and <code>equals()</code>.
 * <p>
 * The location can be set using the {@link IbisProperties#LOCATION} property.
 * The <code>%HOSTNAME%</code> sequence is replaced by the hostname, the <code>%DOMAIN%</code> sequence
 * is replaced by the domain, where each "level" in the domain name is a separate
 * level in the location, and <code>%FLAT_DOMAIN%</code> sequence is replaced by the domain,
 * as a single level in the location.
 * <code>%PID%</code> is replaced by the process id, if available, or <code>-1</code>.
 * Unrecognized sequences are left untouched.
 * <p>
 * The default location is specified
 * below, in {@link #DEFAULT_LOCATION}.
 * <p>
 * Note that this interface extends {@link Comparable} and {@link
 * Iterable}. So, locations can be sorted, and the user can iterate over
 * the levels in a location.
