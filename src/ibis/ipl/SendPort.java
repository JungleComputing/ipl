/**
 * Initiates and naintains connections to one or more receive ports.
 *
 * When creating a sendport, it is possible to pass a
 * {@link SendPortDisconnectUpcall} object.
 * When a connection is lost for some reason, the 
 * {@link SendPortDisconnectUpcall#lostConnection(SendPort,
 * ReceivePortIdentifier, Throwable)} upcall is invoked.
 * This upcall is completely asynchronous, but Ibis ensures that 
 * at most one is alive at any given time.
 * A receiveport can forcibly close the connection,
 * in which case any communication from the sendport
 * will cause a lostConnection upcall. 
 * <strong>
 * The user may not assume that the mere fact that a
 * receive port forcibly closes its connections causes a lostConnection
 * call on the send port side.
 * The send port has to do communication to detect that there is trouble.
 * </strong>
 * 
 * If no {@link SendPortDisconnectUpcall} is registered, the user is NOT
 * informed of connections that are lost.
 * If the port supports connection downcalls, the user can
 * use the {@link #lostConnections()} method to poll for connections 
 * that are lost.
 * Again, the send port has to do communication to detect that there may be
 * trouble.
 *
 * Connections are unrelated to messages! If the sending of a message 
 * did not generate an exception, this does not mean that it actually 
 * arrived at the receive port. There may still be data in Ibis or 
 * operating system buffers, or in the network itself. 
 *
 * For a given sendport, only one message is alive at any time.
 * This is done to prevent flow control problems.  When a
 * message is alive, and a new message is requested, the request
 * blocks until the live message is finished.
 *
 * The following {@link Managable} items are recognized:
 * <br>
 * "Messages"  the number of messages sent;
 * <br>
 * "MessageBytes" the number of bytes sent in messages (multicasts are counted
 * once);
 * <br>
 * "Bytes" the total number of bytes sent;
 * <br>
 * "Connections" the total number of connections made with this port;
 * <br>
 * "LostConnections" the number of lost connections;
 * <br>
 * "ClosedConnections" the number of closed or disconnected connections;
 *
 * Other items may be recognized, depending on the Ibis implementation.
