/** 
 * A message used to write data from a {@link SendPort} to one or more
 * {@link ReceivePort}s.
 * <p>
 * A <code>WriteMessage</code> is obtained from a {@link SendPort} through
 * the {@link SendPort#newMessage SendPort.newMessage} method.
 * At most one <code>WriteMessage</code> is alive at one time for a given
 * </code>SendPort</code>.
 * When a message is alive and a new message is requested, the requester
 * is blocked until the live message is finished.
 * <p>
 * For all read methods in this class, the invariant is that the reads must
 * match the writes one by one. An exception to this rule is that an
 * array written with any of the <code>writeArray</code> methods can be
 * read by {@link ReadMessage#readObject}. Likewise, an
 * array written with the {@link WriteMessage#writeByteBuffer} method can be read
 * by {@link ReadMessage#readObject} (resulting in a byte array), and also by the
 * {@link ReadMessage#readArray(byte[])} method.
 * <strong>
 * In contrast, an array written with
 * {@link #writeObject writeObject}
 * cannot be read with <code>readArray</code>, because
 * {@link #writeObject writeObject} does duplicate detection,
 * and may have written only a handle.
 * </strong>
 * However, an array written with {@link #writeArray(byte[])} can be
 * read with {@link ReadMessage#readByteBuffer(ByteBuffer)}. 
 * <p>
 * The {@link #writeObject(Object)} and {@link #writeString(String)} methods
 * do duplicate checks if the underlying serialization stream is an object
 * serialization stream: if the object was already written to this
 * message, a handle for this object is written instead of the object itself.
 *<p>
 * When the port type has the {@link PortType#CONNECTION_ONE_TO_MANY}
 * or {@link PortType#CONNECTION_MANY_TO_MANY} capability set,
 * no exceptions are thrown by write methods in the write message.
 * Instead, the exception may be passed on to the <code>lostConnection</code>
 * upcall, in case a {@link SendPortDisconnectUpcall} is registered.
 * This allows a multicast to continue to the other destinations.
 * Ultimately, the {@link WriteMessage#finish() finish} method will
 * throw an exception.
 * <p>
 * Data may be streamed, so the user is not allowed to change the data
 * pushed into this message.
 * It is only safe to touch the data after it has actually been
 * sent, which can be ensured by either calling {@link #flush},
 * {@link  WriteMessage#finish()} or {@link #reset},
 * or a {@link #send} followed by a corresponding {@link #sync}.
