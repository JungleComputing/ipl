 * {@link #joined(IbisIdentifier) joined()} call will be generated. <BR> - For
 * any given Ibis identifier, at most one {@link #left(IbisIdentifier) left()}
 * call will be generated. <BR> - An Ibis instance will also receive a
 * {@link #joined(IbisIdentifier) joined()} upcall for itself.
 * <p>
 * If the {@link IbisCapabilities#MEMBERSHIP_TOTALLY_ORDERED} is specified for
 * this Ibis, all Ibis instances receive all
 * {@link #joined(IbisIdentifier) joined()},
 * {@link #left(IbisIdentifier) left()}, and
 * {@link #died(IbisIdentifier) died()}, upcalls in exactly the same order.
