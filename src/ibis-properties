#
# This file describes the properties that can be associated with
# an Ibis implementation. The format of this file is described
# in the java.util.Properties.load() API.
#
# Properties must be formulated in such a way that a suitable Ibis
# implementation can be selected by specifying the required properties,
# which must then be a subset of the properties of this Ibis
# implementation.
#
# Note that an Ibis application may later on only create port types
# with properties that are a subset of the properties supplied by
# the Ibis implementation.
#
# All properties fall in one of the following property categories:
#

PropertyCategories:	communication worldmodel serialization

#
# The possible "communication" properties are:
#   OneToOne
#	one-to-one communication is supported (if an Ibis does not support
#	this, you may wonder what it DOES support ...)
#   OneToMany
#	one-to-many communication is supported (in Ibis terms: a sendport
#	may connect to multiple receiveports).
#   ManyToOne
#	many-to-one communication is supported (in Ibis terms: multiple
#	sendports may connect to a single receiveport).
#   Poll
#       receiveport.poll() is supported.
#   ReceiveTimeout
#       blocking receives with a timeout are supported.
#   FifoOrdered
#   	messages from a sendport are delivered to its receiveports in the
#   	order in which they were sent.
#   Numbered
#	messages from sendports of a port type with this property are
#	given global sequence numbers so that the application can order
#	them. The numbering is per port type.
#   Reliable
#	reliable communication is supported.
#   AutoMessageUpcalls
#	message upcalls are supported and polling for them is not required.
#   AutoUpcalls
#	synonym for AutoMessageUpcalls (historical name)
#   PollMessageUpcalls
#	message upcalls are supported but polling for them is required. When an
#	Ibis implementation claims that it has this, it may also do
#	AutoMessageUpcalls but polling does no harm. When an application asks
#	for this (and not AutoMessageUpcalls), it must poll.
#   PollUpcalls
#	synonym for PollMessageUpcalls (hystorical name)
#   ExplicitReceipt
#	explicit receive is supported.
#   ConnectionDowncalls
#	connection downcalls are supported.
#   ConnectionUpcalls
#	connection upcalls are supported.

# There are some implied properties, for instance OneToMany implies OneToOne.
#

OneToMany:	OneToOne
ManyToOne:	OneToOne
AutoMessageUpcalls:	AutoUpcalls
PollMessageUpcalls:	PollUpcalls
AutoUpcalls:	AutoMessageUpcalls
PollUpcalls:	PollMessageUpcalls

#
# The possible "worldmodel" properties are:
#    Open
#	this means that Ibises can join the run at any time.
#    Closed
#	this means that the Ibises that can join the run are determined
#	at the start of the run.
# Note that Ibis implementations may support both.

worldmodel:	Open, Closed

#
# The possible "serialization" properties are:
#    Byte
#	readByte/writeByte and readArray/writeArray(byte[]) are supported.
#    Data
#	read/write and readArray/writeArray of primitive types are supported.
#    Object
#	Some sort of object serialization is supported. An Ibis implementation
#	will, of course, specify what kind of object serialization it supports.
#	The "Object" property allows a user to just ask for object
#	serialization, and not care if it is Ibis or Sun serialization.
#    Ibis
#	Ibis serialization is supported.
#    Sun
#	Sun serialization (through java.io.ObjectOutputStream/InputStream) is
#	supported.
#
# Note: Ibis serialization does not support versioning, and does not support
# non-symmetrical writeObject/readObject methods (where readObject does not
# read everything that writeObject writes).
#

serialization:	Byte, Data, Object, Ibis, Sun
