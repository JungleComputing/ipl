Ibis source release installation

    Before you try to configure Ibis, you must set the environment
    variable JAVA_HOME; see also the system-specific notes at the end
    of this text.

    The Ibis software requires at least a 1.5 version of Java. With a
    1.4 or older version of Java, some parts of Ibis will not compile.
    Suitable versions of Java can be obtained from the web.
    IBM has versions for Linux and AIX
    (at http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java),
    SUN has versions for Solaris, Linux, and Windows (at http://java.sun.com), 
    and Apple has a version for Mac OS X (at http://developer.apple.com/java).

    The Ibis build process requires `ant', a software building tool similar to
    `make', but written in Java, and well-suited for building Java software.
    At least version 1.6.5 is required. Ant is available from
    http://ant.apache.org.

Build

    Build by typing "ant".

    You can also build a binary release by typing "ant ibis.zip". This
    will create an ibis.zip file that can be unpacked on another system
    and that contains everything needed to compile and run an Ibis
    application.

API
    The Ibis API documentation can be built by typing "ant javadoc".
    This will build a "javadoc" directory.
    Point your favorite HTML viewer to "javadoc/ipl/index.html" to view
    the API documentation.

System-specific notes

Linux, Solaris, other Unix systems
    Install a recent Java SDK, at least 1.5, and set the JAVA_HOME
    environment variable to the location where it is installed,
    for example
        export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/java/jdk1.5
    or
        set JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/java/jdk1.5
    for CSH users.
    It is probably best to add this to your .bash_profile, .profile,
    or .cshrc file (whichever gets executed when you log in to your
    system).
    Also make sure that this Java is in your PATH.

Mac OS X
    Set the environment variable JAVA_HOME to "/Library/Java/Home".
    You are required to install the Java SDK. See the Linux notes on
    how to set environment variables.

Windows 2000, Windows XP
    Install a recent Java SDK, at least 1.5. This will get installed in
    for instance "c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0". You can set the
    JAVA_HOME environment variable to this path by going to the
    Control Panel, System, the "Advanced" tab, Environment variables,
    add it there and reboot your system. IPL_HOME can be set
    similarly.

Cygwin
    See the notes on Windows 2000, Windows XP.
    Note: there is a separate ipl-run script for Cygwin in the bin-directory,
    called ipl-run.cygwin. It is wise to move that to ipl-run.
