through this system, please Email your report to ceriel@cs.vu.nl.

Before  reporting  a bug, please make sure that you have the latest Ibis

(see the bugtracking page). Please supply the output, and also supply
the reason why you think that it represents a bug. Give the complete
command line that triggers the bug, and supply everything we need to try
