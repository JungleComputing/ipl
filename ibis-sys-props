# ignored.
# ibis.pool.host_names

# Optional property, gives the index of the current host in the list of host

# If not supplied, it is determined by looking up the current host in
# the list of host names.
# ibis.pool.host_number

# Cluster name of the current node.
# ibis.pool.cluster			unknown

# Contains the key identifying the current run. If not present, the

# not present either, "unknown" is used.
# ibis.pool.key				unknown

# Must contain the port number on which the <code>PoolInfoServer</code>

# Enables statistics about the use of classes that have not been rewritten

# When set to true, data serialization and ibis serialization no longer
# save all writes of a basic type to an array. These calls are passed on
# to the layer below instead.
# ibis.io.noarraybuffers		false

# Possible values for ibis.io.conversion are: hybrid, chunk, wrap, simple.
# Its value determines the way arrays of basic types are converted to bytes.
# With "simple", each element is converted using shifts and bit-wise ands.
# With "chunk", NIO is used to convert chunks of the array at a time.
# With "wrap", the NIO "wrap" method is used when the size is larger than
# the internal buffer size. With "hybrid", "simple" is used for small arrays,
# "chunk" is used for larger arrays.
# ibis.io.conversion			hybrid

# When set to true, data serialization and ibis serialization use buffers
# from a cache instead of allocating new ones when the flushed ones cannot
# be re-used yet. This only makes some sense (although it does not improve
# performance) with MessagePassing Ibis, because with all other Ibis
# implementations, the buffers can be re-used after a flush.
# Maybe just remove???

# Enable some assertions in the serialization code.
# ibis.io.assert			false

# When writing arrays of a basic type that are smaller than this size
# (in bytes), the elements are written one by one, when using data or ibis
# serialization. It is not a good idea to fiddle with this, as this changes
# the wire format.
# ibis.io.smallarraybound		256
