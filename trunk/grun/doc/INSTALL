Grun can be used to conveniently run Ibis jobs in a Globus Grid environment.
Grun is written in Python so in addition to Globus, it requires the
installation of the "pyGlobus" Python interface to the Globus job
submission API.

By default Grun assumes that pyGlobus is installed in directory
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/python.  Otherwise, pyGlobus will have to be added to
PYTHONPATH by the user.
If the script "grun" is run from $PATH, the support Python source files
globus_support.py and griddefs.py should be installed from in
the same directory as grun, or the directory containing them
should be added to PYTHONPATH so that Python can find them.

Note that the grun README file assumes that grun is installed
in /usr/local/package/grun.  In case the version distributed with
Ibis is used, the paths referred to (e.g., the grun "etc" directory
containing Ibis support scripts) changes accordingly.

Grun has been tested to work with:
- Python version 1.5.2 and 2.2.3
- Globus versions 2.2.4 and 3.2 (see http://www.globus.org)
- pyGlobus version 2.2.x-1.0.2 (with Globus 2.2.4)
  and the snapshot version from CVS (with Globus 3.2).
