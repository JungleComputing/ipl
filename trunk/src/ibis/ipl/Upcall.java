/**
 * Describes the interface for upcall based communication.
 * Creating a {@link ReceivePort} with an <code>Upcall</code> allows for
 * upcall based communication.
 * The <code>ReceivePort</code> must be created with the
 * {@link PortType#createReceivePort(String, Upcall)} method, or one of
 * its other variants with a <code>Upcall</code> parameter.
 * After the receive port is created, upcalls can be enabled through the
 * {@link ReceivePort#enableUpcalls()} call, and disabled through the
 * {@link ReceivePort#disableUpcalls()} call. Initially, upcalls are
 * disabled.
 * <P>For a given receive port, only one message can be active at any time,
 * and by default, the message is active as long as the upcall is active. 
 * However, the message can be de-activated using the
 * {@link ReadMessage#finish()} call. This is the only way in which
 * a receive port can have more than one active upcall.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Note: to prevent deadlocks, upcalls are not allowed to block
 * in condition synchronization or network access as long as the message is
 * active.</strong>
 * However, upcalls <strong>are</strong> allowed to enter/exit
 * synchronized methods for critical section operation.
 * </p>
