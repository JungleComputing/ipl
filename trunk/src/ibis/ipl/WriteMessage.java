/** 
 * The Ibis abstraction for data to be written.
 * A <code>WriteMessage</code> is obtained from a {@link SendPort} through
 * the {@link SendPort#newMessage SendPort.newMessage} method.
 * At most one <code>WriteMessage</code> is alive at one time for a given
 * </code>SendPort</code>.
 * When a message is alive and a new message is requested, the requester
 * is blocked until the live message is finished.
 * For all write methods in this class, the invariant is that the reads must
 * match the writes one by one. The only exception to this rule is that an
 * array written with any of the <code>writeArray</code> methods can be
 * read by {@link ReadMessage#readObject ReadMessage.readObject}.
 * <strong>
 * In particular, an array written with {@link #writeObject writeObject}
 * cannot be read with <code>readArray</code>, because
 * {@link #writeObject writeObject} does duplicate detection, and may
 * have written only a handle.
 * </strong>
 * 
 * The {@link #writeObject(Object)} and {@link #writeString(String)} methods
 * do duplicate checks if the underlying serialization stream is an object
 * serialization stream: if the object was already written to this
 * message, a handle for this object is written instead of the object itself.
 *
 * When the port type has the ONE_TO_MANY capability set, no exceptions
 * are thrown by write methods in the write message.
 * Instead, the exception may be passed on to the <code>lostConnection</code>
 * upcall, in case a {@link SendPortDisconnectUpcall} is registered.
 * This allows the multicast to continue to the other destinations.
 * Ultimately, the {@link WriteMessage#finish() finish} method will
 * throw an exception.
