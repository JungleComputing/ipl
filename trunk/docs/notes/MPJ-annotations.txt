Virtual Topologies
------------------
Depending on the underlying algorithm logical communication structures, 
like hypercubes or graphs, may appear, called virtual topologie in MPJ. 
At the moment, virtual topologies are not supported by MPJ/Ibis. Just 
linear rank numbering.



Intercommunication
------------------
It is not possible, that two processes, both members of different groups, 
can exchange messages. MPJ/Ibis does not support MPI-like inter- 
communication at the moment. To achieve intercommunication, a new group, 
e.g. derived from the group of MPJ.WORLD_COMM, has to be constructed 
containing the processes that are supposed to communicate to each other.



Derived Datatypes & Multidimensional Arrays
-------------------------------------------
Since Java provides derived datatypes natively, by using Java objects, 
there is no real need to implement derived datatypes in MPJ/Ibis. 
Nevertheless contigous derived datatypes are supported to obtain the 
functionality of the reduce operations MPJ.MINLOC and MPJ.MAXLOC, which 
need at least a pair of values inside a given array. At the moment 
MPJ/Ibis supports one-dimensional arrays. Mutlidimensional arrays may 
be sent as an object, but in place receive is not possible in this case.
