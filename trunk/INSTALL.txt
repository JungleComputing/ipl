Ibis installation

    Before you try to configure Ibis, you must set the environment
    variable JAVA_HOME; see also the system-specific notes at the end
    of this text.

    The Ibis software requires at least a 1.5 version of Java. With a
    1.4 or older version of Java, some parts of Ibis will not compile.
    Suitable versions of Java can be obtained from the web.
    IBM has versions for Linux and AIX
    (at http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java),
    SUN has versions for Solaris, Linux, and Windows (at http://java.sun.com), 
    and Apple has a version for Mac OS X (at http://developer.apple.com/java).

    The Ibis build process requires `ant', a software building tool similar to
    `make', but written in Java, and well-suited for building Java software.
    At least version 1.6.1 is required. Ant is available from
    http://ant.apache.org.

Configuration

Configuration without high-speed LAN

    If you don't have a high-speed LAN for which you require an Ibis
    module (like GM (Myrinet), MPI, or Panda) you have to do no configuration.

Configuration with high-speed LAN

    If you do have a high-speed LAN for which you require an Ibis
    module (like GM (Myrinet), MPI, or Panda), you must configure
    Ibis by typing "ant configure".

    You will be asked for the path to a number of support libraries. If you
    don't have one or more of these libraries, just hit "ENTER".
    The configuration setup figures out which of the support libraries
    actually exists. The Ibis build does not attempt to build the native
    code for absent modules.

Changes to your configuration

    If you want to change your configuration or want to set
    parameters for the build process, the preferred way is to
    change the generated file "build-properties" in the build-files
    directory.
    Changes are currently:
    - paths to support libraries;
    - switching on/off of native compiler optimization or debug symbol
      generation;
    - native code compiler selection.

Build

    Build by typing "ant".  Afterwards, you can run a simple test by
    running "ant test". Before running tests, however, you need to set the
    IBIS_HOME environment variable to the path where Ibis is installed.
    See the system-specific notes on how to set environment variables
    on Windows.
    You can also build a binary release by typing "ant ibis.zip". This
    will create an ibis.zip file that can be unpacked on another system
    and that contains everything needed to compile and run an Ibis
    application.

API
    The Ibis API documentation can be built by typing "ant docs".
    This will build an "api" directory within the "docs" directory.
    Point your favorite HTML viewer to "docs/api/index.html" to view
    the API documentation.

System-specific notes

Linux, Solaris, other Unix systems
    Install a recent Java SDK, at least 1.5, and set the JAVA_HOME
    environment variable to the location where it is installed,
    for example
        export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/java/jdk1.5
    or
        set JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/java/jdk1.5
    for CSH users.
    It is probably best to add this to your .bash_profile, .profile,
    or .cshrc file (whichever gets executed when you log in to your
    system).

Mac OS X
    Set the environment variable JAVA_HOME to "/Library/Java/Home".
    You are required to install the Java SDK. See the Linux notes on
    how to set environment variables.

Windows 2000, Windows XP
    Install a recent Java SDK, at least 1.5. This will get installed in
    for instance "c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0". You can set the
    JAVA_HOME environment variable to this path by going to the
    Control Panel, System, the "Advanced" tab, Environment variables,
    add it there and reboot your system. IBIS_HOME can be set
    similarly.

Cygwin
    See the notes on Windows 2000, Windows XP.
