This directory contains Ibis, a programming environment for wide-area
distributed computing in standard Java. In addition, it contains an
RMI (Remote Method Invocation) implementation on top of Ibis.
It also contains Satin, a package designed for running divide-and-conquer
programs on distributed memory systems and grid computing systems.
Finally, it contains GMI (Group Method Invocation), a package implementing
group communication using method invocations. This package is still very
much in an "alpha" state.
