    Separate build file, because it uses a nested ant call, which does
    not work if it includes targets with the same name from several
    places. If this sounds too complicated, just try and put this target
    in build.xml, and see what happens when you invoke it. Or never mind.

    Anyway, this build needs to be invoked with -Dversion=<version>
    where <version> is the version of this release as if it was set in
    the "normal" build.xml file (example: "-2.0rc").

    the path of this release within the repository must also be
    specified with -Dpath=path, and is prepended with /svn/ibis/ipl/ automatically -->

    <property name="version" value="non-existent"/>
    <property name="path" value="invalid"/>
