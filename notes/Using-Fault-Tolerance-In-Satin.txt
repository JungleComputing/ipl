 Using Fault Tolerance in Satin
 ------------------------------
 
 Gosia WRZESINSKA
 
 Fault tolerance in Satin is implemented by recomputing jobs lost as a
 result of processor crashes. To improve the performance of the
 algorithm, we use Global Result Table in which we store results of
 so-called "orphan" jobs, which otherwise would have to be discarded.
 The results of orphan jobs are reused while recomputing jobs lost in
 crashes. 

 Fault tolerance in Satin comes in many flavours:

 1. The job results in the Global Result Table can be identified either
 by job parameters or job identifiers (integer numbers). Using job
 identifiers is benefitial for applications with large job parameters.
 However, using job identifiers is only possible, when the maximal
 branching factor of the Satin execution tree can be determined.
 
 2. The Global Result Table can be either replicated or distributed.
 With replicated table, each processor has an identical copy of the
 table. Storing a job result in the table means broadcasting this result
 to all processors. For applications with large job results (e.g.
 Raytracer) this is inefficient, and using distributed table is
 recommended. With distributed table, a job result is stored only in the
 local replica of the table and a _pointer_ (i.e. processor ID) is
 broadcast to other processors. 
 
 3. There are two approaches to storing orphan jobs in the Global Result
 Table. In the first approach ("with aborts"), we store only those parts
 of the orphan jobs that are finished when a crash is detected. The rest
 is aborted. In the second approach ("without aborts"), when a crash is
 detected, we store a special "lock" entry for each unfinished, _whole_
 orphan job (most of them are unfinished, for finished ones we simply
 store the results). When the job is finished, we replace the lock entry
 with the job result. At the moment, the "with aborts" version performs
 better. The "withouts aborts" version, although it saves more work,
 influences load balancing which results in worse performance. However,
 it does much fewer broadcasts (about 20 times).
 
 4. For comparison purposes, we also implemented a "naive" version of
 fault tolerance, which recomputes jobs lost in a crash, but does not
 use the Global Result Table and simply discards orphan jobs.
 
 
 How to use fault tolerance:
 
 STEP 1 ----------------------------------------------------------------- 
 enable fault tolerance, by passing the flag -Dibis.satin.ft=true to java.

 STEP 2 ------------------------------------------------------------------
 chose the flavour
 
 2A ----------------------------
 to use job identifiers instead of job paremeters add
 
	-satin-branching-factor <n>
	
 to the appliation command line. n is the branching factor for the
 application. Here are branching factors for our applications:

 Adaptive Integration (adapint): 2
 Barnes Hut (barnes_inline): 8 
 Set Cover (cover): 2
 Fibonacci (fib, fib_threshold): 2
 Ida* (ida): 4
 Knapsack (knapsack): 2
 Matrix Multiplication (mmult): 8
 N over K (noverk): 2
 N Queens (nqueens): the same as problem size
 Prime Factorization (primfac): 2
 Raytracer (raytracer): 4
 SAT Solver (sat): 2 (DPLLSolver)
 Travelling Salesman Problem (tsp): the same as problem size
 
 2B ----------------------------
 to use replicated Global Result Table, pass the following flag to java:
	
	-Dibis.satin.ft.grt.replicated=true
 
 to use distributed Global Result Table, pass the following flag to java:
    
	-Dibis.satin.ft.grt.replicated=true
 (this is the default).
	
 2C ----------------------------
 to use the "with aborts" version, pass the following flag to java:
 
	-Dibis.satin.ft.noAborts=true
 (this is the default).
 
 to use the "without aborts" version, pass the following flag to java:

	-Dibis.satin.ft.noAborts=true
	
 
 2D -----------------------------
 to use the naive version, pass the following flag to java:
 
	-Dibis.satin.ft.noTable=true -Dibis.satin.ft.noAborts=false

 
 STEP 3 -----------------------------------------------------------------
 run the application (see Running-Satin-Applications.txt) and try to kill
 some nodes, for example with prkill. You can also use tell nodes to
 commit a suicide by specifying
 
	-satin-kill <time>
