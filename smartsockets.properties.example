# This section defines the default low-level connection setup behavior of the 
# smartsockets library. 

###
# Should the sockets be capable of NIO ? Default is true
# smartsockets.networks.nio=true

###
# Should server sockets be created in a specific port range ? By default no 
# port range is used. As a result serversockets will be created on any free 
# port, unless the user explicitly specifies a port number. The port range must 
# have the following format:
#
#   RANGE(,RANGE)* 
# 
# where RANGE has the format
#
#   P         to specify a single port number
#   P1-P2     to specify a port range from P1 to P2 (inclusive) 
# 
# For example the range '1000,5000-5999,6001' specifies that a port should be 
# used between 5000 and 5999 or with the value 1000 or 6001.
#
# smartsockets.networks.port_range=

###
# When a machine only has site-local or link-local addresses (e.g., when the 
# machine is behind a NAT-box), smartsockets can try to discover the global 
# address of the machine using several mechanisms, such as STUN or UPnP.

# Should STUN be used to discover the external address of a machine ? The STUN 
# protocol sends a UDP packet to an external server which returns a UDP packet 
# containing the global address of the sending machine. This mechanism is 
# usually quite fast, but may take longer if is encounters a stubborn firewall 
# on its path. The default value is false. A list of STUN servers can also be 
# specified.
#
# smartsockets.networks.external.stun=false
# smartsockets.networks.external.stun.servers=iphone-stun.freenet.de,stun.xten.net,stun.fwdnet.net,stun.fwd.org

# Should UPnP be used to discover the external address of a machine ? The UPnP 
# protocol attempts to communicate with the NAT box itself to retrieve the 
# external address of the machine. This may take a couple of seconds. It does 
# recuire UPnP to be switched on in the NAT box, which is not always the case.
# This mechanism is typically only supported in 'consumer hardware', like ADSL 
# or Cable modems. The default value is false
#
# smartsockets.networks.external.upnp=false
#
# If UPnP is used, it is possible to enable 'port forwarding' which,  
# upon creation of a serversocket, will signal the UPnP device to allocate an 
# external port number and automatically forward all incoming connections to the 
# serversocket. The default value is false. Note that this may not work on all 
# UPnP devices.
#
# smartsockets.networks.external.upnp.forwarding=false

# If required, the user can also explicitly set the global network address of 
# the machine. Note that this is not necessary, since smartsockets will usually 
# also work if no 'global' addresses are known.  
# smartsockets.networks.external.manual=

###
# When a connection is created to a remote machine that has multiple addresses, 
# smartsockets tries each of the addresses one-by-one until a connection is 
# established or the operation times out. The order in which the addresses are 
# tried can be specified here. 

# By default smartsockets will try to come up with a reasonable order in which 
# to connect. For example, if two machine both have a global address and a local
# one (in the same range), the local address will by tried first. On the other 
# hand, if a machine with a single global address tries to connect to a machine 
# with several local addresses and a global one, the global address will be 
# tried first. If required, it is also possible to force a specific order here, 
# for example: 
# 
#    "..=site,link,global"
#
# This example will always try site local addresses first, followed by link local 
# and global addresses.
#
# The default setting is 'auto'.
#130.37.199.2
# smartsockets.networks.default=auto

###
# Smartsockets also allows you define rules which specify the connection order 
# on a per network basis. We will give an example that configures smartsockets 
# to recognise the five clusters of the DAS-2 system and use the site-local 
# addresses inside each cluster and the global addresses between clusters. 

# Start by defining the five networks (one for each cluster).
#
# smartsockets.networks.define=fs0,fs1,fs2,fs3,fs4
 
# Next, we specify which machines belong to each network, and how they should 
# setup connections inside the network cluster and between 
# networks

# The network of the fs0 (VU) cluster
#
# smartsockets.networks.fs0.range=130.37.199.0/255.255.255.0
# smartsockets.networks.fs0.preference.internal=192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0
# smartsockets.networks.fs0.preference.default=global
130.37.199.2
# The network of the fs1 (Leiden) cluster
#
# smartsockets.networks.fs1.range=132.229.24.0/255.255.255.0
# smartsockets.networks.fs1.preference.internal=192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0
# smartsockets.networks.fs1.preference.default=global

# The network of the fs2 (UvA) cluster
#
# smartsockets.networks.fs2.range=192.16.186.0/255.255.255.0
# smartsockets.networks.fs2.preference.internal=192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0
# smartsockets.networks.fs2.preference.default=global

# The network of the fs3 (Delft) cluster
#
# smartsockets.networks.fs3.range=130.161.211.0/255.255.255.0
# smartsockets.networks.fs3.preference.internal=192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0
# smartsockets.networks.fs3.preference.default=global

# The network of the fs4 (Utrecht) cluster
#
# smartsockets.networks.fs4.range=131.211.38.0/255.255.255.0
# smartsockets.networks.fs4.preference.internal=192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0

# This sections defines the high-level modules and connection setup behavior of 
# the smartsockets library. The different modules available to the library will 
# be described first. 

###
# These are the available high-level modules. The default value is 
# 'direct,reverse,splice,routed'
#
smartsockets.modules.define=direct,hubrouted

# For each of the modules used, we specify the name of the class implementing 
# the module. This allows the modules to be loaded dynamically. If no class 
# names are specified, the default values are based on the module names:
#
# 'smartsockets.modules.<name>=smartsockets.virtual.modules.<name>.<Name>
#
# where <name> is the module name in lower-case and <Name> is the module name 
# starting with an upper-case letter.
#
smartsockets.modules.direct=smartsockets.virtual.modules.direct.Direct
#smartsockets.modules.reverse=smartsockets.virtual.modules.reverse.Reverse
# smartsockets.modules.splice=smartsockets.virtual.modules.splice.Splice
# smartsockets.modules.routed=smartsockets.virtual.modules.routed.Routed
smartsockets.modules.hubrouted=smartsockets.virtual.modules.hubrouted.Hubrouted

###
# We now define in which order the modules should be tried when a connection is   
# created. Each of these modules should be defined above, but it is not 
# necessary to use all of the modules here. The default order is: 
# 'direct,reverse,splice,routed' 
#
smartsockets.modules.order=direct,hubrouted

###
# Most of the modules require out-of-band control messages to set up a  
# connection to other machines. These control messages are send to a 'hub' 
# who will forward them (possibly via several other hubs) to the destination 
# machine. Using this property a default hub location can be specified. If 
# this property is not set, smartsockets will try to locate a hub on the 
# local network using UDP multicast. Port and timeout values related to this 
# multicast are shown below. If the multicast fails, some of the modules will 
# not work. Note that this property can also be set on the command line during 
# application startup.     
#
# smartsockets.hub.address=
#
# The Hub itself can also be configured using the following poperties. It is 
# possible to change the port the hub accepts connections on, define a list of 
# 'virtual clusters' (explained below) to which it should limit is services, and 
# define a simple human-readable name which makes is easier to read the 
# debugging output.
#
smartsockets.hub.port=23456
# smartsockets.hub.clusters=
# smartsockets.hub.simple_name=


###
# These properties determine the port at which the hubs listnens to lookup 
# requests of the clients. The timeout is used on the client side to determine 
# how long the client should wait for a reply. The default values are port 
# 24545, and a timeout of 5 seconds.
#
smartsockets.discovery.port=23458
# smartsockets.discovery.sleep=


###
# Smartsockets can define 'virtual clusters'; sets of machines which have  
# specific rules for connecting inside and outside of their set. Below, we will 
# show an example of how these 'virtual clusters' can be defined, and how their 
# connection rules are specified. 

# Start by defining the three 'virtual clusters'.
#
# smartsockets.cluster.define=routers,cluster1,cluster2

# Next, we specify for each of the clusters how we can determine if a machine is
# part of the cluster, and how connection setup works inside and between the 
# clusters. Note that we can also define specific rules for combinations of 
# clusters. The 'default' preference may be a ordered list of modules, or 'none'
# if no connection an to 'unknown cluster' is allowed. 

# Currently the only way to determine membership of a cluster is 'manual', 
# which means that the user should explicitly specify which cluster a machine 
# belongs to. The property below shows how this is done. Note that it is often 
# easier to specify this on the command line of the application itself.  
#
# smartsockets.cluster.member=

# The setup for virtual cluster 'routers'
#
#smartsockets.cluster.routers.preference.membership=manual
#smartsockets.cluster.routers.preference.inside=direct,reverse,splice
#smartsockets.cluster.routers.preference.default=direct,reverse,splice

# The setup for virtual cluster 'cluster1'
# 
smartsockets.cluster.cluster1.preference.membership=manual
smartsockets.cluster.cluster1.preference.inside=direct
smartsockets.cluster.cluster1.preference.routers=direct
smartsockets.cluster.cluster1.preference.cluster2=hubrouted
smartsockets.cluster.cluster1.preference.default=none

# The setup for virtual cluster 'cluster2'
#
smartsockets.cluster.cluster2.preference.membership=manual
smartsockets.cluster.cluster2.preference.inside=direct
smartsockets.cluster.cluster2.preference.routers=direct
smartsockets.cluster.cluster2.preference.cluster1=hubrouted
smartsockets.cluster.cluster2.preference.default=none

###
# Several properties which normally not need to be changed. The default values 
# are shown below. 
#
# smartsockets.default.backlog=20
# smartsockets.default.timeout=1000

# End of high-level section.
