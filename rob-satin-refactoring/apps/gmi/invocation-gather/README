Invocation combining benchmark, for throughput as well as latency.
All members in the group invoke the method, the parameters are combined,
using either flat-combining or binomial-combining, depending on the parameters.
and the method is invoked as either a group invocation or a single invocation,
depending on the parameters.

Parameters are:
-count <count>
    number of invocations per test (default: 10000)
-size <size>
    size of the byte-array to use for throughput test (default: 50k);
-repeat <repeats>
    number of times that the test is repeated (default: 10)
-flat
    use flat combining (this is the default)
-bin
    use bin combining
-group
    invoke on all members of the group (this is the default)
-single
    invoke on a single member of the group
-lat
    run the latency test
-tp
    run the throughput test
-copy
    copy part of the parameters when combining them
-no-copy
    don't copy the parameters when combining them (this is the default)


If neither -lat nor -tp are given, both latency and throughput tests are run.
