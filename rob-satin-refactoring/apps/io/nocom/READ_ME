This program examines the performance of serialization. It creates
serialization streams on top of dummy streams, with or without conversion
of basic types to bytes (without conversion can only be measured for
Ibis serialization).

The program recognizes the following options:

-read		measure read performance
-write  	measure write performance
-conv   	measure performance with conversion (this is the default)
-noconv   	measure performance without conversion (only for ibis
		serialization).

-object <classname>
		any object class that implements the TestObject interface
		can be given here. Some example classes are supplied here:
		DITree, DList, List.

-byte		use byte arrays. Default size is 10000.
-int		use int arrays. Default size is 10000, so length = 2500.
-long		use long arrays. Default size is 10000, so length = 1250.
-float		use float arrays. Default size is 10000, so length = 2500.
-double		use double arrays. Default size is 10000, so length = 1250.

-c <count>	repeat <count> times per test. Default is 10000.
-t <ntests>	do <ntests> tests. Default is 10.
-s <size>	sets the array size.

-sun		measure Sun serialization
-ibis		measure Ibis serialization
