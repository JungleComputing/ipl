A solver for the Satisfiability problem.

This directory contains several implementations of a solver for the
Satisfiability (SAT) problem. Some variants are very simple but
highly parallel, others are more sophisticated, but are more difficult
to parallelize.

All variants take exactly one argument: the name of the problem file.
This file should be in DIMACS file format, see
{@link http://www.intellektik.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/SATLIB/Benchmarks/SAT/satformat.ps}.

Note that none of the solvers here is comparable to professional SAT
solvers.

The variants:

@see SATSolver		Fairly sophisticated solver, mainly sequential.
@see SimpleSATSolver	Simple, highly parallel solver.
