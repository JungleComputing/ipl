This is an RMI implementation on top of Ibis.

This package and its sub-packages implement an (incomplete)
version of Java RMI on top of the Ibis communication layer.

The apps/rmi directory contains some example applications that run
on Ibis RMI, including ANT build files.

The most notable difference with "ordinary" Java RMI applications is that
an Ibis RMI application must start its own RMI registry. In addition,
the Ibis RMI package is called ibis.rmi and not java.rmi. However,
the Ibis rmic can take care of that through the -java2ibis flag.
