/** 
 * The <code>SerializationOutput</code> interface specifies which methods
 * must be implemented by any serialization output stream type. Some
 * of these methods may just throw an exception, depending on the
 * serialization type. For instance, the <code>writeInt</code> method
 * of a "byte" serialization output stream will just throw an exception.
 * <p>
 * For all write methods in this interface, the invariant is that the reads
 * must match the writes one by one. The only exception to this rule is that an
 * array written with any of the <code>writeArray</code> methods can be
 * read by
 * {@link SerializationInput#readObject SerializationInput.readObject}.
 * <strong>
 * In particular, an array written with {@link #writeObject writeObject}
 * cannot be read with <code>readArray</code>, because
 * {@link #writeObject writeObject} does duplicate detection, and may
 * have written only a handle.
