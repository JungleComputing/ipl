#
# This file lists the Ibis implementations, and their property files.
# The format is that described in de java.util.Properties#load(InputStream),
# with an implementation name as propertey key, and a list of property
# filenames as property value.
#
# The order in this file is not significant, because
# java.util.Properties#load(InputStream) is used to read it.
# 
# This file is read as follows:
# first, the "names" property is read, to obtain the list of "nicknames"
# of Ibis implementations.
# Next, each of these nicknames is regarded as a property name, and its
# corresponding value is regarded as a fully qualified classname, giving
# the implementation of the corresponding Ibis.
# Each of these implementation names, in turn, is regarded as a property
# name to obtain a list of property files for this Ibis.
#
# The "names" property also gives a "preference" order: fastest one first.
# The first Ibis that matches the properties required by the application
# and is present on the system at hand is used.
#
# A "default" Ibis is also specified.
