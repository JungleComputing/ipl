Using Ibis from Eclipse

NOTE: this text is incomplete.


This file explains how to configure Eclipse, the Java programming
environment, to access the Ibis CVS repository, and allow editing
of the Ibis software.

These instructions were written using on Eclipse 3.0.0.  Eclipse can
be downloaded from <http://www.eclipse.org>.


Registering the Ibis CVS repository
-----------------------------------

To access the Ibis CVS repository, from Eclipse or otherwise, you need
a valid account on the DAS computer in Amsterdam, and must be able to
log in on that account using SSH, without having to type a password. To
commit to the Ibis repository, you also need sufficient write permissions
on the DAS computer.

To tell Eclipse where the Ibis repository is located do the following:

1. Select menu entry Window | Open Perspective | Other ...

2. Select the `CVS Repository Exploring' perspective.

   A new collection of windows will be shown, with one large one titled
   `CVS Repositories'.

3. Right-click in the working area of the `CVS Repositories' window,
   and select New | Repository location ...

4. In the dialog that appears, enter
    Host: fs0.das2.cs.vu.nl
    Repository path: /usr/local/proj/ibis/Repository
    Connection type: extssh
    and also your user name and password on the DAS computer.

5. You may want to change the label of the CVS repository by
   editing the properties of the entry you created.
