 * The marker interface that indicates which methods of a class are

 * interface that extends <code>ibis.satin.Spawnable</code> and specifies the
 * methods that may be spawned. The interface extends java.io.Serializable
 * because the "this" parameter is also sent across the network when work is
 * transferred.
