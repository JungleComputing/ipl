<BODY>
The NetIbis package is an {@link ibis.ipl.Ibis} <I>implementation</I>
providing a common interface to multiple pluggable network
drivers for buffered communication.

It uses a two layered architecture. The high level layer actually
provides an implementation of the Ibis interface conforming to the IPL
specifications. The low level layer is made of a set of network drivers.
