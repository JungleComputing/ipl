Here is a list of Ibis releases.

2.1 (14 April 2008)
   This release mostly fixes some problems in the 2.0 release.
   Also, there are a few (upwards compatible) additions to the IPL,
   and the internals of the registry have changed considerably.

2.0 (10 November 2007)
   This is the first release of Ibis in four years that changes the IPL.
   Significant changes to the IPL include:
   - The StaticProperties mechanism is now split up into "properties"
     and "capabilities".
   - A IbisFactory is now used to create ibisses.
   - Port types are now create before, not after an ibis is created.
   - ReceivePorts no longer have a single global namespace.
     Instead each ibis instance has a local namespace for its receive
     ports.
   - The registry no longer has functionality for "looking up" or
     "listing" IbisIdentifiers and ReceivePortIdentifiers. This makes
     implementations of the registry much more scalable and stable.

   Other changes to Ibis include:
   - The distribution of Ibis now only includes The IPL and TCP based
     implementations. The programming models, and any additional
     implementations are all released separately.
   - Support for the Smartsockets library. This allows Ibisses to
     traverse firewalls and NATS more reliable than before.

1.4 (Sep 15, 2006)
   This is the first release that is also available as a binary release.
   It contains an almost completely rewritten version of Satin, and lots
   of fixes. 

1.3 (Feb 14, 2006)
   This release contains the following additions:
   - shared objects for Satin. This is a replacement (and major improvement)
     of the TupleSpace, which was a hack, really. The TupleSpace is still there,
     but it is deprecated and will probably not be there anymore in the next
     Ibis release.
   - Improved/rewritten connection setup code.
   - Fixed various scalability issues which came up when we tried to run some
     applications on hundreds of nodes. The biggest bottleneck was the
     nameserver, which we now made multithreaded. Another major bottleneck
     was the connection setup in Satin, for which we now added code to set up
     connections lazily.
   
1.2.1 (Dec 2, 2005)
   This is a quick maintainance release for 1.2, fixing a couple of bugs.

1.2 (Sep 20, 2005)
   This release adds MPJ/Ibis, a pure Java implementation of he MPJ programming
   interface that has been defined by the Java Grande forum to provide MPI-like
   message passing for Java applications. With respect to 1.1, there are also
   a couple of bug fixes.

1.1 (Jun 13, 2005)
   This is mostly a maintainance release for 1.0. It fixes several bugs,
   and has some clarifications in the Javadoc.

1.0 (Nov 24, 2004)
   The first Ibis release. This release includes the IPL, and the following
   implementations of it:
   - TcpIbis, which is an implementation on top of TCP,
   - NioIbis, which is an implementation on top of Java NIO.
   - MessagePassing Ibis, which is an implementation on top of Panda (and
     MPI, but that is not really tested).
   - NetIbis, which can do TCP, UDP, GM, and probably others.
   This release also contains Ibis RMI, which is a (incomplete)
   re-implementation of Java RMI, Satin, which is an implementation of the
   divide-and-conquer programming model, and GMI, which is an RMI enhanced
   with group communication.
