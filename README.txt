** Ibis README **

Ibis is an open source Java grid software project of the Computer
Systems group of the Computer Science department of the Faculty of
Sciences at the Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.  The
main goal of the Ibis project is to create an efficient Java-based
platform for grid computing.

This Ibis distribution contains the Ibis communication library (defined
by the Ibis Portability Layer (IPL)) and several implementations of this
IPL. Some example applications are provided in the "examples"
directory.

The programmer's manual ("docs/progman.pdf") contains a detailed
description of the Ibis Application Programmer's interface (API),
illustrated with example code fragments.

The javadoc of Ibis is available in "javadoc/index.html".
