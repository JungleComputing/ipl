This directory contains a simple traffic simulator, where cars and trucks
with individual prefered speeds travel along a 3-lane road. They overtake
when they are blocked too much by preceding cars (and when it is
safe).

It uses the Ibis communication classes without any intermediate layers.

The program takes no parameters.
