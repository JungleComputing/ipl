*** Website ***

- new toplevel for the website
- change "related work" to "links" (like the ProActive site)
- change UDP in documentation picture to being incomplete (striped)

*** Plugtest ***

- Gossip Registry
- Remove porttype from registry
- parse "classic" ip-address:port strings in smart-sockets (e.g. nameserverclient)
- instead of TcpIbisIdentifier extends IbisIdentifier make IbisIdentifier final and
  include a byte array for the Ibis implementation specific information. This makes
  it easier for the nameserver to use not-known ibisses without duplicating all the "generic"
  data such as name, cluster, etc.
- make pools explicit in the registry (ibis.getpool() etc)
- make it possible to monitor (parts of) ibis.

*** Ibis 2.0+ ***

general:
- extend clusters to a hierarchical model:
     e.g., world.grid5k.sophia.machine321
- to think about: would it be a good idea to allow an active upcall per
  connection instead of per receiveport? This would make satin more simple:
  no longer a receiveport per sender.

- ibisidentifier -> Comparable (for Ana)
+ ibisc : gmic + rmic + satinc + ... (does not replace javac) (Done Ceriel)
+ load ibisses dynamically from jar files (like JavaGAT) (Done Ceriel)
- run central nameserver on fs0
- split up ibis.jar in multiple files (in a sane manner)
+ binary release (Done ibis-1.4 Ceriel)
- make javadoc available in a file for eclipse somehow
+ move applications to a real tree (Done 1.4 Ceriel)
- network(cluster) simulator
- steering interface
- remove deprecated functionality
- while(true) {fix eclipse warnings}
- change codmon performance measurements to "sane" benchmarks
- more efficient clone? Maybe generate code that clones without using 
  serialization. Could be done for objects passed as a param
  to a spawn, for instance. If code is not there, fall back to current impl.
- migrate leftover prints to log4j (should we? Performance!)
- improve performance of Ibis serialization for non-rewritten code.
+ automatically started nameserver hangs when application crashes or exits
  with code 1 (with ant test) (Fixed Ceriel: Added shutdownHook in RunProcess).
+ ant clean in apps gooit ant test output files niet weg (fixed Ceriel)
+ ant in applicaties doet niet eerst een clean (fixed Ceriel)

- na een connectionLost upcall geeft het sluiten van de port soms:
    Trying to close a sendport port while a message is alive!
    Dat is natuurlijk zo, maar ja, de connectie is weg, dus dan zou je willen dat
    de close gewoon netjes zonder exception terug komt. --Rob


nameserver+connection stuff:
+ joins, leaves and died messages have to be ordered to each other as well. --Rob
  They are (Ceriel)
+ deadlocks in pinger, forwarders --Rob
  Fixed serious race (in nameserver, and TcpIbis) --Ceriel

+ enable control hub by default --Rob
+ if a control hub is started, ibises cannot connect to the normal server again?
+ allow different connection types to nameserver simulaneously: 
  one ibis should be able to connect with routed messges, while others have 
  a direct connection --Rob
+ -Dibis.nameserver=SOME_IP -> kijk of 1 van onze interfaces SOME_IP heeft 
  (niet alleen eerste)...
Fixed by Jason's smartsockets library.

- add out-of-band communication support to the Nameserver interface

ipl:

- make ibis.ipl.Ibis an interface
- add abstract classes for all classes in ibis.ipl to ibis.impl
- add a final class ibis.ipl.IbisFactory which calls ibis.impl.IbisFactory
  with reflection. It shouldn't import ibis.impl.IbisFactory as this would make
  the ipl depend on ibis.impl (and ibisUtil, and IbisConnect, and....
- IPL += sendPort.connect(ReceivePortIdentifier[] receivers);
- close van poorten (in shutdownhooks)
  docs vertellen niet dat je niet een close mag doen terwijl een message
  levend is
  Ceriel: ??? Hoe doe je dat (in een shutdownhook belanden als er een message
  levend is ??? En, de javadocs vertellen dat wel degelijk.

+ add a way to create local receiveports local to and Ibis
  in addition to global receiveports (done Ceriel)
+ add SendPort.connect(IbisIdentifier ibis, String receivePortName)
  (done Ceriel)
- add Registry.lookup(IbisIdentifier ibis, String receivePortName)
- remove Registry.lookupIbis()
- remove (deprecated) createIbis(String name)
- change Ibis.toString() to returning a "friendly"(user-printable), but not 
  necessarily unique, string.
  
rmi:
- check Ibis RMI registry:
  + you don't have to actually start one; (Fixed Ceriel)
  + registers url's, not names. (Done Ceriel (the other way around ...))
  + Don't use bind()/unbind() from the nameserver. Instead, implement
    a real registry thread on one of the nodes (or even have a separate
    rmi registry). (Done Ceriel)

satin:
- if main throws an exception, we exit with code 0. Ant test also succeeds.

- make scalable ibis / scalable satin (don't keep sockets open) --Rob

- add semantic analysis to the compiler
- forgotten sync statements
- make return / throw an implicit sync again?
- add comments to abort / inlet machinism
- check satin caches.
- shutdownhook -> System.exit
- satinc does not understand monitorenter/monitor exit instructions (othello)
- detection of what is an inlet: now, if the invocation is inside a try-catch
  it is assumed to be an inlet. Is this OK? (MAybe change to checked Exception)
- shared objects model: no stubs are used. -> write methods on the orignal object
  are not broadcast. Only if you get it as param from a spawn it is broadcast!
  This is very confusing --Rob
+ remove dependancy on IPUtils and hostname (mostly done, except for masterHome; Ceriel)
+ ant test should also run satin apps sequentially
  (It does, does'nt it? (Ceriel))

satin-so:
- count all messages+sizes for the total messages/data sent statistics --Rob
- do not send the same object (and the same version) twice.
  This can happen if it is both broadcast, and pulled at the same time --Rob
- Allow shared objects to be passed anywhere in the parameter data 
  structures. Now only directly as a param. Maybe use stubs instead of
  direct access? This would make the implementation much easier --Rob
- message combining does not help because:  (--Rob)
    - object-id is sent every time (long string)
    - combiner is synchronized
    - overhead of method calls, serialization
- remove export of shared object from interface. An application can mark any
  initialization functions as being write functions for the same nett result.
  

abstract implementation:
- check _all_ properties in _every_ Ibis
- add support for properties in a ".ibis" config file
- if closed.world is selected, check if ibis.pool.hosts is set, and ignore
  joins beyond total hosts, and all leaves.

implementations:
- (re)implement MPIIbis
- implement stacking Ibis
+ remove PandaIbis (done Ceriel)
+ remove NetIbis (done Ceriel)

connect stuff:
- Rob: allow user to load socket types per *connection* use the 
       property map for this
- control hub client side always binds to default local ip/port 
  (partially fixed, but not fully correct yet --Rob)
- routed messages logging crashes
- use routed messages *while* trying to setup TCP splicing in the background
- write a good anyTCP for control_links -Rob
- support universal plug and play

future projects:
- build *Ibis: a stacking ibis

apps:
- check results of the different barnes versions
