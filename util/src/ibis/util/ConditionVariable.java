/**
 * Condition variable synchronization construct.
 *
 * Condition variables are part of thread synchronization primitives of the
 * {@link Monitor} construct. Threads can wait on a condition variable,
 * and condition variables can be signalled by other threads to wake up one
 * waiting thread. A bcast call wakes up all waiting threads on a
 * ConditionVariable.
 *
 * A thread that calls <code>cv_wait</code>, <code>cv_signal</code> or
 * <code>cv_bcast</code> must have locked the {@link Monitor} that owns this
 * ConditionVariable.
 *
 * Condition Variables can be <code>interruptible</code>. For interruptible
 * Condition Variables, <code>Thread.interrupt</code>ing the {@link Thread} that
 * is waiting on this Condition Variable causes the waiting thread to return
 * with an {@link InterruptedException}. Non-interruptible Condition Variables
 * ignore <code>Thread.interrupt</code>.
 *
 * A Condition variable is created by means of the {@link Monitor#createCV()}
 * or the {@link Monitor#createCV(boolean)} method.
