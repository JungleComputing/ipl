 * first obtain an identification number, give that identification number to
 * someone else, and then wait until that someone connects an object to that
 * identification number, and then collect that object. So, an "object" consumer
 * first calls <code>get()</code>. This gives him an identification ("ticket").
 * He gives this ticket to an "object" producer. This producer at some point
 * produces an object and calls <code>put(ticket, object)</code>. Meanwhile,
 * the consumer calls <code>collect(ticket)</code>, which will block until
 * an object has been connected to the ticket, and then return that object.
