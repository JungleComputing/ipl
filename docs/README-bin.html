distributed computing in standard Java. In addition, it contains an
RMI (Remote Method Invocation) implementation on top of Ibis.
It also contains Satin, a package designed for running divide-and-conquer
programs on distributed memory systems and grid computing systems.
Then, it contains GMI (Group Method Invocation), a package implementing

This package does not require special installation. Just place this directory
wherever you want it. To compile Ibis applications, you need to set the
JAVA_HOME environment variable to the root directory of your Java installation,
so if your Java lives in <code>/usr/java/bin/java</code>, set your JAVA_HOME
to <code>/usr/java</code>. You may also need to set the IBIS_HOME
environment variable to where you placed the Ibis tree.
