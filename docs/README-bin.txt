Ibis README

Ibis is an open source Java grid software project of the Computer Systems
group of the Computer Science department of the Faculty of
Sciences at the Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
The main goal of the Ibis project is to create an efficient Java-based
platform for grid computing.

This Ibis distribution contains the following:

- The Ibis communication library (defined by the Ibis Portability Layer (IPL))
  and several implementations of this IPL.
- Satin, a package for running divide-and-conquer applications.
- RMI (Remote Method Invocation), an implementation of the Java RMI for Ibis.
- GMI (Group Method Invocation), a flexible group communication package.
- MPJ, a pure Java implementation of the Java versino of MPI.

Ibis is free software. See the file "LICENSE.txt" for copying permissions.

This package does not require special installation. Just place this directory

The programmer's manual in the docs directory ("docs/progman.pdf" or
"docs/progman/progman.html" for a HTML version) contains a detailed
description of the Ibis Application Programmer's interface (API),
illustrated with example code fragments.  It also explains how to
compile and run your Ibis application.
The javadoc of the API is available in "docs/api/index.html".
