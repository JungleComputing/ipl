The binary release of Ibis does not need any special installation.
Simply unzip the distribution where you want. You might want to set the
IPL_HOME environment variable to this location.

The Ibis software requires at least a 1.5 JDK version of Java. With a
1.4 or older version of Java, this Ibis release will not run.  Suitable
versions of Java can be obtained from the web.  IBM has versions for AIX
(at http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java), SUN has versions for
Solaris, Linux, and Windows (at http://java.sun.com), and Apple has a
version for Mac OS X (at http://developer.apple.com/java).

Building the provided example and benchmarks applications requires
`ant', a software building tool similar to `make', but written in Java,
and well-suited for building Java software.  At least version 1.6.5 is
required. Ant is available from http://ant.apache.org.

System-specific notes

Windows 2000, Windows XP
    Install a recent Java SDK, at least 1.5. This will get installed in
    for instance "c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0". 

    You can set the IPL_HOME environment variable to this path by going to
    the Control Panel, System, the "Advanced" tab, Environment variables,
    add it there and reboot your system.

Cygwin
    There is a separate ipl-run script for Cygwin in the bin directory, 
    called ipl-run.cygwin. It is wise to move that to ipl-run.
