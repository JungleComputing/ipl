 Using Fault Tolerance in Satin
 ------------------------------
 
 Gosia WRZESINSKA
 
 Fault tolerance in Satin is implemented by recomputing jobs lost as a
 result of processor crashes. To improve the performance of the
 algorithm, we use Global Result Table in which we store results of
 so-called "orphan" jobs, which otherwise would have to be discarded.
 The results of orphan jobs are reused while recomputing jobs lost in
 crashes. 

 Fault tolerance in Satin comes in two flavours, either with or without
 global result table. The version without global result table (the "naive"
 version) recomputes all jobs lost in a crash, including all orphans.
 
 How to use fault tolerance:
 
 STEP 1 ----------------------------------------------------------------- 
 chose the flavour

 2A ----------------------------
 to use a Global Result Table, you don't have to do anything (this is
 the default).

 2B ----------------------------
 to use the naive version, pass the following flag to java:
 
	-Dsatin.ft.naive=true

 
 STEP 3 -----------------------------------------------------------------
 run the application (see the Ibis Programmers Manual) and try to kill
 some nodes. You can also tell nodes to commit a suicide by specifying
 
	-Dsatin.killTime=<time in seconds>

which instructs satin to commit suicide after <time in seconds> seconds.
