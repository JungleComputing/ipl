Some parts of Ibis use Log4j loggers as a replacement for lots of debugging
prints like "if (DEBUG) System.out.println("...");". The problem of these
prints was that they were a bit of a mess, some went to System.out, others went
to System.err, et cetera. The advantage of using Log4j is that logger output
can be redirected to a file, different loggers can write to different files,
and they can be configured using a configuration file. Disadvantage is that,
although cheap, they sometimes just are not cheap enough ... so we did not
use them everywhere.

Here is an overview of the loggers that we currently use in Ibis.

Below is an example log4j.properties file. For more information on Log4j
see http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/
